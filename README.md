# Pharmacy-Web-Frontend-Template
## This is one of the final year assignments given by our university for Frontend Developement, further description is given below.

The PNG (screencapture.png) of the developed page is present in the repository. Everything else is the implementation of the same using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The page works on IE9+,Firefox,Chrome, and Safari browsers.

Best coding / optimization practices you are familiar with has been followed while developing this. The implementation is pixel perfect as much possible, and it has been made sure to use only DIVs (no Tables\no flex).

## Approach:
1. Created all static skeleton html page.
2. Made it pixel perfect and cross browser. 
You can use this Chrome plugin (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en).

## Haves:
1. There is a header section on the page that will work like a slider.
2. Images/Videos section have pop-up to play video or images. Implement the popup for photos and videos section.
