# Pharmacy-Web-Frontend-Template
This was one of the assignments given by Josh Technology Group during their recruitment for Frontend Developer Role, further description is given below.

The PNGs of the mock up page is present in the repository. Everything else is the  implementation of the same using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The page works on IE9+,Firefox,Chrome, and Safari browsers.

Best coding / optimization practices you are familiar with has been followed while developing this. The implementation is pixel perfect as much possible, and we have made sure to use only DIVs (no Tables).

Approach :
1. Create all static html.
2. Make it pixel perfect and cross browser. You can use this Chrome plugin (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en).

Haves:
1. There is a header section on the page that will work like a slider.
2. Images/Videos section have pop-up to play video or images. Implement the popup for photos and videos section.
